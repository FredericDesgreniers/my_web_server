This is meant as a very low overhead / barebones server to serve my personal website. Made it since most other solutions seemed both slower and too much overkill for this. 


## Components:
### http
Http data structures for requests / responses.

### http_server
Server specific code, things that deal with incoming requests

### pool
A simple worker pool to process requests

### static
Static contents such as html content
